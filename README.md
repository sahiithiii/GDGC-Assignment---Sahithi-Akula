GDGC Web Development Assignment

I have created an E-commerce platform for the given UIUX design by the GDGC team for the round 2 selections.
I have first written a html with only few divs so that when fetching the api, the products and cart can appear in the right places. Then I have written the CSS code to match the reference template. 
I faced problems for incrementing the items in the cart and had many errors and a lot of bugs, but I managed to debug and learn from this assignment. This assignment helped me strengthen my javascript knowledge and I was able to explore about integrating API's into the website. 
I am thankful that I was able to learn so much and also showcase my front end skills through this assignment.
